There are full licences and concessionary licences, for people aged 12-18, retired people, the unemployed. Licence holders can update their details, for example when they move. Licences can also be renewed. The Environment Agency sells around 1.4 million fishing rod licences each year, generating £25m in revenue.

The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) needs to ensure the safe, secure and decent transport of prisoners between courts, police stations and prisons. The provision of this service is outsourced. The NOMS Probation and Contracted Services Directorate is tendering for the contract for Prisoner Escort and Custody Services for London.

An average of 24,000 prisoners per month need to be transported between London's 24 Crown Courts, 43 Magistrates' Courts, 24 prisons and 131 police stations. The locations include many of the most high profile courts in England and Wales, including the Royal Courts of Justice, the Central Criminal Court (the “Old Bailey”) and Westminster Magistrates' Courts. From time to time the provider also needs to transport prisoners between the courts in London and prisons in other parts of the UK. The transport of Category A (male) or Restricted Status (female) prisoners (people whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public or national security and therefore need to be transported with maximum security) is excluded from this contract and is managed directly by HM Prison Service.

The contractor is required to provide the safe, secure and decent transport of prisoners between the courts and their associated prisons and police stations, as well as the effective operation of court custody suites and associated docks. The contractor needs to liaise with multiple agencies including HM Courts and Tribunal Service, the Youth Justice Board, and the Metropolitan Police.
