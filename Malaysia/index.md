## Overview

Open data has the potential to have a significant impact in Malaysia: from the the way the government makes decisions, to economic value created by new businesses, to the health and happiness of individuals. 

The Open Data Institute has put together a four day programme of activities covering training, strategy and policy in Open Data. 

This is an intensive and interactive course will help MDeC team members and colleagues from across the Malaysian Government who will need to learn how to publish and exploit open data to improve efficiency, create new services and to act on opportunities. We will cover the best practice involved in using and publishing open data and the legal and policy requirements in order to reduce risk.
