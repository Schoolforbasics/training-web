## **Presentations**

**Introducing open data** ([Slides](/resources/Introducing_Open_Data.pdf)   [Interactive HTML5](http://theodi.github.io/presentations/training_OneDay_Intro.html))
	
We discover what open data is and what it means on a global scale. What are the potential applications, benefits and risks and why are we talking about it now?

**Law, licensing and open data** ([Slides](/resources/law_and_licensing.pdf))

We look at the critical importance of applying the correct license to your data and what this involves. 

**Best practice in publishing open data** ([Slides](/resources/Ensuring_Data_Quality.pdf))

There are some very good guidelines to help you publish data. We take a look at a number of them and analyse their strengths and weaknesses.
