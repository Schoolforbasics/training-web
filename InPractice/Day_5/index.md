On the data expedition day, attendees are encouraged to split into groups and use the knowledge gained throughout the week and create an output to take away with them to help in future work. 

The following handout is used to help identify groups of people:

## **Processing the UK Trade Info data** 

The UK Trade info data in <a href="https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/Pages/DataDownloads.aspx">raw form</a> is very hard to process due to the proprietary nature of the data. The data is plain text but the structure, while detailed and accurate, is proprietary. In order to make the data usable, <a href="../stuff/uktrade-parsing-scripts.zip">these scripts</a> writen in ruby can take the raw data and output usable csv. 

These scripts were written and tested against the data from December 2013.
