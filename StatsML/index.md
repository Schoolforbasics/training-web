## Overview

This highly practical one day course looks at how to used advanced statistical and machine learning tools and techniques with open data.

The course is split into two main sections, covering the threory and application of statistics to existing data before then looking at prediction using machine learning and classification. In both sessions, estensive use is made of the R Toolkit. 

## Session 1 - Statistics

### Key topics:
* Statistical methods
* The risks of over measuring
* Introducing R for statistics
* Applied statistics and open data

### Slides
* Coming soon

## Session 2 - Machine learning

### Key topics:
* Machine learning methods
* Machine learning in R
* Applied machine learning in open daa

### Slides
* Full introduction to R, incl Machine Learning \[[HTML]\](fullr/) \[[PDF]\](fullr/fullr.pdf) \[[Source data]\](fullr/fullr.zip)

### Machine Learning exercise

[This dataset](data/training-data.csv) contains data relating to houses in San Fanscisco and New York. Your task is to design a decision tree which sorts them into each pot, you are not allowed to use the Target or Zip code columns to do this. Once you are happy with your decision tree, use the [test dataset](data/test-data.csv) to see if you have built a decision tree than can work for any input data. What was your success rate?

To find out the answers, take a look at the [R2D3 blog](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/).
